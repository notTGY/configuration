# My configurations

* vimrc is pretty basic (made it portable and resource-independent)

### some progs I need:
  * [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  * [ALElint](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale)
  * tmux ( if not windows )
  * serve ( npm i -g serve )
  * [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  * [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (when showing off to noobs)
  * [discord](https://discord.com/download) (you know...)
